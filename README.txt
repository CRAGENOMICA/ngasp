========

This repository contains the Next generation of the Genome Analysis Toolkit ($NgaSP). The contents
of this repository are 100% open source and released under the LGPL 2.1 license (see [LICENSE.TXT](https://github.com/cragenomica/ngaSP/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT)).

NgaSP aims to bring together well-established tools from the [NgaSP](http://www.cragenomica.org/WIP) and
[WIP](http://cragenomica.github.io/WIP/) codebases under a streamlined framework,
and to enable selected tools to be run in a massively parallel way on local clusters or in the cloud using
[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). It also contains many newly developed tools not present in earlier
releases of the toolkit.
